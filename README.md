## Copy editing

Create a new link by editing the [`content.yml`](content.yml) file. When editing on GitHub, click the pencil icon to start editing the file:

<img width="293" alt="screen shot 2018-11-02 at 11 32 19" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/47910420-15142280-de93-11e8-8ab8-b8616abb7e60.png">

Only thing to remember is to keep the indentation as in this example:

```yaml
links:
    - name: JupyterHub Notebook
      url: https://longurl.com
    - name: Another JupyterHub Notebook
      url: https://longurl.com
```

This example would result in:

### Editing workflow

The basic workflow goes like this:

1. edit the [`content.yml`](content.yml) file
2. when committing changes, create a new branch and open a pull request
3. ask for review & approval of pull request
4. have the pull request merged

<img width="696" alt="screen shot 2018-11-02 at 11 50 14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90316/47911346-7dfc9a00-de95-11e8-9414-71fe63b1577b.png">

The `master` branch is protected from being pushed to, enforcing the following rules:

-   every change has to be done in another branch and go through a pull request against `master`
-   pull requests need to be reviewed and approved
-   pull requests need to pass the CI status checks
-   pull requests can be merged by a defined list of members only
-   when merged into `master`, pull request changes are deployed automatically to live

This will then initiate an automatic build & deployment process, and your change should be live within a minute or so.

## Development

This repo is a simple page builder utilizing [gulp](https://gulpjs.com) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

Will start a live-reloading local server, reachable under [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337).

## Deployment

Page lives in a S3 bucket and deployment happens automatically via Travis based on the rules described in the [editing workflow](#editing-workflow). For that to work, the following environment variables need to be setup in Travis:

-   `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
-   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
-   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Every `master` Travis build triggers this script which can also be used for manual emergency deployments:

```bash
npm run deploy
# executing ./deploy.sh
```

DNS for `datascience.oceanprotocol.com` is setup via Cloudflare, pointing to the S3 bucket under `datascience.oceanprotocol.com.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com`
